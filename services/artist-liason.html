                An artist liaison, also known as an artist relations or artist coordinator, is a key intermediary between artists and the various stakeholders involved in their career, such as record labels, event organizers, promoters, and venue staff. Their primary responsibility is to facilitate effective communication and collaboration, ensuring that artists' needs and preferences are met while aligning with the objectives of the entities they interact with. Artist liaisons handle logistics, hospitality, and scheduling, ensuring artists are comfortable and well-informed before and during events, and they often act as a buffer between artists and external parties, resolving any issues that may arise to create a positive and productive working environment. Their role is crucial in maintaining the artist's well-being and the success of live performances and projects.
